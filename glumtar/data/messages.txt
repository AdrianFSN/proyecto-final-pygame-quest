Welcome on board, Commander!
You are our last chance to save the human species.
Planet Earth is now uninhabitable.
Our unique hope is Glumtar!
A planet where human life is possible.
But where is Glumtar?
Nobody knows...
However, you will find it, won't you?
Pilot the spacecraft across
planets until landing on Glumtar.
Use the key arrows (Up and Down)
on your keyboard to move the spaceship.
This won't be a pleasure trip.
Space is full of meteorite storms.
Go and save us, Commander. Good luck!
